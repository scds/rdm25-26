# Crash Course: Data Management for Postdocs
Start your postdoctoral work at McMaster off on the right track with Research Data Management Services! Postdoctoral research work ranges from an individual project within a team to collaborating with a faculty mentor. We'll speak to the breadth of postdoc scholarship in this introductory workshop. You'll learn about research data management best practices and how investing a small amount of time in organizing your data now can save you a lot of time and prevent future headaches. We will go over best practices for data planning, storage, organization, preservation, and sharing. We’ll also discuss how postdocs can be advocates for research data management and guide best practices for reproducible research within their lab or group.
