# Communities Empowered by Data 101

Community-led data practices empower and support community-led grassroots actions and initiatives. Data are valuable and we need to work together to take care of them, from the initial planning stages of a project to where it lives after the work is complete. In this 101-level session, we’ll introduce the Community Research Data Toolkit—a new Pressbook filled with guidance and resources to support communities in taking an active role in data management. Topics include using data management plans as tools for building trust, exploring options for long-term community-held data, and more. Following an interactive overview, we'll save some time to workshop challenges and possibilities through a set of applicable case studies.

Participants will learn to:
- Summarize RDM best practices and what Data Management Plans and Data Deposit look like in community-based research
- Locate available tools, training, and guidance
- Appraise the tools and prepare to implement Community control for data in your work. 

This session is designed for non-profits, activists, community organizations, and the researchers and data professionals who work with them!
