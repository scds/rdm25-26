# Data Management Plan Bootcamp (In-Person)

Let us be your body double with this in-person bootcamp! Data Management Plans (DMPs) are both incredibly helpful research tools and increasingly required for grants but it can hard to know how to complete a Data Management Plan if itâ€™s your first time. This session is carefully timed for researchers completing a CFI or Tri-Agency grant this fall. If you're in the process of creating a DMP, either for a grant application or for your own research, join RDM Services for this afternoon session. The RDM services team will provide tailored guidance as you write your plan on site, and we'll have some light snacks and refreshments to keep you going. Come away with a clear path forward or even a finished DMP! 

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
- Identify the 5 key components of a data management plan (DMP).
- Compare strong and weak responses in each section of a DMP.
- Develop a tailored outline, or potentially a complete draft, of their own DMP!

This participatory session is especially relevant for researchers at all levels in the beginning stages of a research project or streamlining best practices for their research team. Come on your own, send your research staff, or bring your whole research group. Let us know if you're joining as a research team - we'll make sure you get a table to work together at! 

## Workshop Preparation 

Make sure you have access to any data-related information needed to work on your DMP. Consult with colleagues, PIs, or anyone else to ensure you have access to ethics applications, security measures, consent forms, study protocols, backup systems, storage locations, data types, and any other documentation. 

Please bring your laptop and a refillable water bottle. We will have snacks and drinks to keep you all going!
